## Description 
This is intended be a rhythm game where music is playing and notes come down along the screen and the player has to time button presses to get a high score. 

## Instructions
Once the code is compiled you will be brought to a start menu. Your only options are to start the game or quit. Once the game starts the player will have to wait for notes on screen to reach the blue line and press the designated keys on screen. Depending on the timing the players score will go up.

Controls are D, F, J, K.

The scores are as follows:
Miss = -20
Late = -20
Early = -20
Good = 10
Great = 25
Perfect = 50

## How it works
The game is divided into three screens. The start screen, the gameplay screen and the end screen.

The buttons on each screen are accessible using the mouse and will change when hovered over. The keyboard which is used to play the game is only 
accessible on the game screen. Once on the start screen, clicking start will begin the game. With in the game stars will be generated on the top of the screen and move down the screen.

The blue line across the bottom of the screen indicates the area where the stars need to be in order to score points when pressing the corresponding button.
Once the song has ended the player will be brought to a end screen displaying their final score. The player can only exit one the game is complete.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am most proud of the scoring system working correctly so the player is rewarded for playing the game well. I accomplished this by simply assigning an image to an object and checking how well the star notes align with it to give the player a score ranging on how close to the center it is when the button is pressed.
